# Welcome to my new players guide to the mobile game Ulala: Idle Adventure!

https://ulala-guide.now.sh/

This app is designed to be an interactive walkthrough guide for the Ulala: Idle Adventure Mobile game.
It allows you to pick your role and your class, and then view all of the related resources available
to that class.  There are 3 roles: Tank, Healer, and DPS.  Each role has between 2 and 4 classes that
you can choose from.

When viewing the class page, you can see all the skills, and click on a button that will filter out
only the recommended skills for maximum output (be it better healing, better damage, or better tankyness).
It will also show you the recommended items for the other available resources: Attributes, Tempers, and
Clatter Cards.
