    question: "How do you look at dps?",
    answer: "On the combat view, there is a exp/min bar. Click on that bar, and it will open up the detailed combat stats.  Here you can look at the teams dps, pet details, and the realtime skill activation of your team and the boss.  The skill activation tab is particularly helpful for timing interrupts."
